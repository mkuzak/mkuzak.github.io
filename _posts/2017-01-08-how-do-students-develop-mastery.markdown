This is fourth part of 7 part series discussing ideas presented in
[“How Learning Works: 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching”](https://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101).

The fourth chapter of  “How Learning Works” discusses the steps
necessary to develop mastery.  As described in the principle, there
three necessary steps on the path to mastery:

> To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills,
> practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have
> learned.

Students have to acquire component skills before they can practice
integrating them.  Integration process does not come automatically
with acquiring skills, it has to be practised too. Even after
students master combining skills to solve complex tasks they not
necessarily see the similarity of the problems, when they are
presented in different context or apply them in a different domain.

Teachers have to support students in each of those three steps. This
requires:
1. disassembling the problem into component skills
2. facilitating integration by slowly increasing the complexity
3. teaching how to apply new skills through examples,
counter-examples and comparisons

To understand why teachers may make mistakes in this process it is
convenient to look at four stages of the mastery development process:
1. unconscious incompetence
2. conscious incompetence
3. conscious competence
4. unconscious competence

The beginners are at the unconscious incompetence stage when they do
not know what they don’t know. The experts of the topic are in the
state of unconscious competence. They do not know what they know.
Experts behave automatically and instinctively. Because of those
*expert blind spots* expert teachers have problems *unpacking* the
problem and defining component skills.

One can support the learning of solving complex tasks through
combining different skills by slowly increasing the complexity.
Students do not learn when “cognitive load” of the task is too high.
The lesson can have a higher impact if some parts of it are
*lightened* so that students can focus on parts most essential to the
learning objectives.

It is important that the students learn how to apply new skills in
different contexts. This is called “transfer”.  As it is with
combining skills to solve complex tasks, the transfer does not come
naturally.  The teacher needs to actively facilitate transfer
learning. This can be achieved by explicitly discussing the
applicability of skills in different contexts and conditions that
determine this applicability.

I think one of the strongest messages of this chapter is that experts
are not necessarily the best teachers. They are also not best
equipped to build good learning materials. In fact, instructors
who are in “conscious competence” phase are most likely to
effectively deconstruct complex skills. I think this is why
Carpentries model works so well. Instructors are usually very close
to the time when they learned those skills by themselves. They
remember what was the most challenging for them, what helped them
better understand complex topics. That is also why it is so helpful
that fresh or soon to be instructors can contribute and help
improving learning materials. I have been recently working more and
more on building various learning materials. At eScience Center, we
are developing tutorials for the software we build. I find that
tutorials are of much better quality when built by someone not
connected to the project as opposed to the developer who suffers from
*expert blind spot*.

The other important message is about slowly increasing the complexity
and avoiding high “cognitive load”. I think this is very difficult to
achieve in short time workshops like Carpentries. There are so many
new concepts: command line, working with the interpreter, new
programming concepts. One example of avoiding cognitive load which
I see works great is using RStudio to teach R. That is mostly thanks
to how good RStudio is. I really miss similar IDE for Python. I know
that some people teach Python with Jupyter notebooks but until now I
only taught with the IPython REPL. This is on my soon to try out
list. If you have experience with using Jupyter at Carpentry
workshops, I’d like to hear from you in the comments. The other
helpful feature adding cheat sheets to the lessons. I am very happy
to see more of those added recently.

The third, which I think has been also popping up multiple times in
previous chapters is how important it is to make comparisons,
emphasising deep features and presenting concepts in various
different context. I never thought about looking at all the lessons
with this in mind and I’m not sure how much connection there is in
between the lessons. Seems like something to look into.
