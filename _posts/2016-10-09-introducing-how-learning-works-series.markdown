I started my learning experience towards becoming [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
Instructor Trainer. As part of my assignment I’m reading
[“How Learning Works: 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching”](https://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101).
The authors extracted core principles from the latest research in
cognitive, developmental, and social psychology, anthropology, education,
and diversity studies and show how we can use them in the classroom.
In a 7 post series, I will be writing about what I have learned and
how those principles are applied or can be applied in
Software Carpentry Workshops.
