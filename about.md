title: About

My name is Mateusz Kuzak. I develop research software. I'm [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) evangelist and I care about quality of the software used in science. I work a lot with javascript and data visualization. I used to work with microscopes, looking at living cells analyzing images. Now working at [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) with researchers from all domains of science. I think a lot about how we should write our scientific software and test my ideas in the wild.
