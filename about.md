My name is Mateusz Kuzak. I develop research software. I'm Software and Data Carpentry evangelist and I care about quality of the software used in science. I work a lot with javascript and data visualization. I used to work with microscopes, looking at living cells analyzing images. Now working at Netherlands eScience Center with researchers from all domains of science. I think a lot about how we should write our scientific software and test my ideas in the wild.

The views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer.
